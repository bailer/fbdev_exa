This is an Xorg driver for the Raspberry Pi

Please see http://elinux.org/RPi_Xorg_rpi_Driver for information regarding its design, installation, configuration and troubleshooting.
This also includes information on how and where to submit bugs.

The driver offloads large composition operations to a proprietary co-processor for which there is no publicly-available documentation. Its instruction set has been reverse engineered by a third party group, and this composition code makes use of this reverse engineer effort. If you are to use this driver feature in a country where reverse engineering or the use of knowledge derived through reverse engineering is not permitted, then please disable this option ("VpuOffload") in the driver configuration file.

The ARM-side driver is released under the existing license that the fbdev driver it was derived from originally used.
The modifications to the X server itself are released under the original license Xorg 7.7 uses.
The VPU code is an independent module and is closed source and not provided here. Do what you wish with the compiled VPU binary however.
